                    </h1>
                    <p>A priest from Heliopolis described it as a food to eat after fasting on the 11th day of Pachons, a month in the ancient Egyptian calendar. Koshary is known as "The food of the Poor"; it consists of fried onions, lentils, rice, macaroni and a red sauce.

                <h1>Molohkeya
                </h1>
                <p>Molokhia is an iconic Egyptian soup made of jute mallow leaves from which the dish gets its name. Those leaves are cooked in a rich chicken broth and flavored with tasha, a fragrant garlic-coriander paste fried in ghee, until velvety. It's a recipe that's particularly nostalgic to me.

                <h1>Mahshi
                </h1>
                <p>Mahshi is an Egyptian dish of vegetables stuffed with rice and cooked in a spiced tomato sauce and it's one of the coziest ways to eat your veggies. Mahshi can be made with squash or eggplants, but our recipe stuffs all the herby goodness into red bell peppers.

                    Feteer meshaltet (Egyptian Arabic: فطير مشلتت [fɪˈtˤiːr meˈʃæltet], literally "cushioned pies" or "cushion-like pies"), often simply referred to as meshaltet (مشلتت), is a flaky Egyptian layered pastry. It consists of many thin layers of dough and ghee and an optional filling. The fillings can be both sweet or savory. Sweet fillings may include cheese, coconut, mehalabiya, malban, Nutella or chocolate, while savory fillings can be anything from ground beef to sausage or cheese. Plain meshaltet is usually soaked in honey and spread with jam or cheese or served with olives. Because of its versatility, meshaltet is often referred to as an Egyptian pizza.[1][2]
